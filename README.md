# Good Practices

## Auth

_we should go for an ELI5 way to do this_

## approach

can include hard topics like auth but also more soft topics like
* how to document
* how to define a minimal lovable product
* how to make architecture decisions
* how to version
* how to avoid technical debt
* how to meet requirements of users
* how to ensure reliability

## good dev practices - for makers and devs

* write and document for your future self
  * begins with naming variables
  * describe the how, the what and the why
  * don't assume anything
* don't try the quickNdirty way - this will end up in doubling the work
* implement some patterns like
  * naming conventions
  * try-catch
  * screenshots that show the important part
